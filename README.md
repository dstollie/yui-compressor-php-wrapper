yui-compressor-php-wrapper
==========================

A Simple PHP wrapper for yahoo's Yui Compressor

I started this project because I couldn't find a good PHP wrapper for the YUI-Compressor which was also easy usable with composer.
I decided to share this project with others because I also wat to give something back to the PHP community. Feel free to use this project for whatever you like. If you strungle with a problem please create an issue. Of course I'm not perfect just like this project so if you've got improvements; share them with us!

I Started to built this project with [gpbmike's PHP-YUI-Compressor project][1], and improved it the way I thought was the best.

##Usage
1. Throw the "yui-compressor-php-wrapper" folder in the "vendor" folder of your project
2. require the project in your project's composer.json file.
```json
{
    "require": {
      "php": ">=5.3.0",
      "dstollie/yui-compressor-php-wrapper": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
